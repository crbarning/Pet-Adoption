# Pet Adoption Website

## Name
Christina B

## Overview/description of the project
This website is a way for people to see what animals are available for adoption and to learn about each pet.

## Details on how to use it or what functionality is offered
From the main screen you use the navigation bar at the top to access the adoption page or the contact page. Scrolling down you will see information on adoption and a preview of animals available as well as a link to the adoption page. On the adoption page you can view all animals and learn about them. When you view the contact page there is a form that submits to formspree. All three pages are responsive for tablet and mobile viewing.

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

## Ideas for future improvement (minimum of 3)
1. I would like to improve layouts for all screen sizes.
2. Have a better understanding of media queries.
3. Learn how to make a picture a link to another page and to a specific location on that page. 

## User stories
1. As someone looking to adopt I want to see multiple options so that I can choose the right pet for me.

2. As a kid I want to choose a pet online so that I can convince my parents to adopt it.

3. As someone who lives far from the pet adoption place I want to choose the pet I want without having to go to multiple locations.
